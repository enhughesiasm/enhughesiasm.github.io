		Worrying was always what I did best. But eventually my worry habit
		spiralled out of control. After years of background anxiety that would <span

		anxiety <span class='text-xl font-bold text-red-700'>peaked</span> and never
		went away.
	</div>
	<div>
		I spent months in constant fear. Each night I lay awake, afraid of how I
		would feel the next day. There seemed to be no escape from this cycle.
		It seemed that the only way out might be something drastic.
	</div>
	<div>
		Naturally, I didn't actually <em>tell anyone</em> how I felt. That would
		be silly.
	</div>
	<div>
		Finally, I couldn't tolerate it any longer. My coping strategy of "hope
		it all went away" was clearly not working anymore. I decided to figure
		out what was happening... and maybe even do something about it.

		I started writing down everything I learned about managing my anxiety,

		It's an odd book, I'll freely admit, but it's the book I wished I could
		read when I was struggling the most. It mixes personal stories, helpful
		advice gleaned from experts, and little tales about wizards and aliens.
		(And lots of embarrassing stories about me, too.)

		As well as the book, there's lots of articles on this website.

		Plus I'm available to give funny & helpful talks about anxiety, online
