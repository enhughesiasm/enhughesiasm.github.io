				👉 You can expect to receive an email newsletter from me
				‘occasionally’; in practice, this means roughly every few weeks
				to every few months.
			</li>
			<li>
				✍️ The content of these emails can be quite varied, but they
				tend to be mainly humorous or thought-provoking stories, along
				with roundups of links to interesting things I've found, and
				articles I've written recently.
			</li>
			<li>
				❗ I don't store any of your data myself: at the time of writing
				I am using <a

					class='text-blue-500 underline hover:text-blue-400'

					Mailchimp</a

				provide on my behalf.
